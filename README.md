# Event-Calender-Management-System


 1. Project Overview
    
 The Event Calendar Management System is a user-centric application designed with a focus on
 enhancing the end-user experience through its intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). The
 system allows users to efficiently create, modify, delete, view, search, and sort events. A notable
 feature of our application is its ability to prevent scheduling conflicts by ensuring that no
 multiple events occur at the same datetime, which helps users manage their schedules more
 effectively. The system clearly displays upcoming events on the dashboard, while also allowing
 access to and organization of both current and completed past events. The GUI is crafted to be
 interactive and visually appealing, with clear, well-structured summaries of events within a
 specified date range, ensuring a comprehensive and user-friendly scheduling experience.
 To achieve optimal performance and efficiency in our event management system, we made
 several key design decisions:

 Features
 ➢ Dashboard: Displays a table of events with options to refresh, remove, and update
 events.
 
 ➢ AddEvent:Form to input details for new events, including title, location, description,
 date, start time, end time, and priority.
 
 ➢ SearchEvents: Allows users to search for events by attributes such as title, location,
 priority, description, and date.
 
 ➢ SortEvents: Provides options to sort events by title, date, or priority.
 ➢ EventHistory: Displays past events.
 
 ➢ Generate Summary: Generates a summary of events within a specified date range.
 
 ➢ Updatebutton : To modify past events
 
 ➢ Removebutton: to remove selected event
